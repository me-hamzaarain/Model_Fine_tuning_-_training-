# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM, CNN, and BERT

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on **sentiment analysis** of reviews using deep learning models including **LSTM**, **CNN**, and **BERT**.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective is to classify customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments using various neural network architectures. The models were evaluated using training/validation accuracy and loss plots, as well as architecture visualizations.

## 🧠 Models Explored

- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory neural network for handling sequential review data.
- **CNN**: Convolutional Neural Network for capturing local features in text.
- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers fine-tuned for classification.
